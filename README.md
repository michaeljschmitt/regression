# regression

Welcome to my Regression Program!
Created by Michael J. Schmitt.
This program was designed to calculate regressions using Excel and aid you in the multiple regression modeling process.
There are a variety of outputs depending on your data set, including:
	-Full regression results
	-Stepwise regression results
	-Regression modelling aids (in .txt and .xlsx formats)
	-Data cleaning results
	-2D regression plot (for single regessor datasets)
	-3D regression plot (for two regressor datasets)

Instructions:
Please enter your data in a worksheet named 'Sheet' of a Excel workbook entitled 'Data' or 'Data.xlsx'.
The first column is for the dependent variable data.
All subsequent columns are for independent variable data.
The first row is for header data.
Each subsequent row is a data point for your regression.
Add an asterisk symbol to beginning of any header after the first column to ignore that column in your regression.
All outputs will be saved to the 'Output' folder.
Double click the program executible once data is entered into the worksheet to run your regression analysis.
Please remember to save workbook and close all related textfiles before running program.
Thanks and enjoy!
