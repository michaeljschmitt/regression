# A Simple Python Regression Program

This program was designed to calculate regressions using Excel and aid you in the multiple regression modeling process.
There are a variety of outputs depending on your data set, including:
<ul>
  <li>Full regression results</li>
  <li>Stepwise regression results</li>
  <li>Regression modelling aids (in .txt and .xlsx formats)</li>
  <li>Data cleaning results</li>
  <li>2D regression plot (for single regessor datasets)</li>
  <li>3D regression plot (for two regressor datasets)</li>
</ul>

Python 3 compatible. SciPy stack and openpyxl libraries required.

Instructions:
<ol>
  <li>Please enter your data into a worksheet named 'Sheet' of an Excel workbook entitled 'Data' or 'Data.xlsx'. The first column is for the dependent variable data. All subsequent columns are for independent variable data. The first row is for header data. Each subsequent row is a data point for your regression.</li>
  <li>Add an asterisk symbol to beginning of any header (after the first column) that you wish to exclude from the regression.</li>
  <li>Double click the program executible once data is entered into the worksheet to run your regression analysis. Please remember to save workbook and close all related text files before running program. All outputs will be saved to the 'Output' folder.</li>
</ol>

Thanks and enjoy!
